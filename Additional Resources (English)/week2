Scheduling/Accepting/Rescheduling/Declining a meeting

Asking for a meeting

    Could we schedule a meeting next week?
    I’d like to schedule a meeting as soon as possible.
    Can we meet and go over this together?
    Perhaps we could meet and go over the details in person?
    Do you have time to meet next week?
    I was wondering if you might have time to meet on Tuesday.

Suggesting a meeting time

    How about Monday at nine?
    How about some time after lunch?
    Could we meet next week?
    Can I suggest we meet at 7.30 on Tuesday evening?
    Would 5 p.m. suit you?
    Would it be possible for us to meet on Friday?

Saying that you can attend.

    Sounds good.
    Yes, that works for me.
    Yes, that would be fine.
    Yes. I can manage that.

Confirming the day and time

    See you on Monday at 9.
    So, I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday at 2 p.m. then.

Saying you are not able to attend

    Sorry, I can’t make it then.
    I’m afraid I have another appointment then.
    I’m a bit tied up then. How about another time?
    The time doesn’t work for me.
    The time is not fine with me.

Agreeing on the length of the meeting

    Should we plan for the whole afternoon?
    How long should we plan the meeting for?
    The meeting should take about one hour and a half.
